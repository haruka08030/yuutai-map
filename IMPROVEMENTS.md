## 🔍 Self-Discovery Protocol (When Queue is Empty)
*If no tasks are listed above, perform these audits in order and generate new tasks based on findings.*

### 1. Code Quality Audit
-   **Linter Check:** Run `flutter analyze`. If errors/warnings exist, create a task to fix them.
-   **Hardcoded Strings:** Search for user-facing strings not in a localization file/const class. Create a task to extract them.
-   **Long Methods:** Identify build methods over 50 lines. Create a task to "Extract Widget".
-   **Magic Numbers:** Identify raw numbers in code (e.g., styling constants). Create a task to move them to `AppTheme` or constants.

### 2. Architecture & Consistency
-   **Logic Separation:** Ensure no business logic exists directly in UI Widgets (Move to Controllers/Providers).
-   **Supabase Sync:** Check `GEMINI.md` schema definition against the actual Supabase table definitions in code. If different, create a task to update documentation.

### 3. Cleanup
-   **TODO Comments:** Search for `// TODO` in the codebase. Convert the oldest/most critical one into a task.
-   **Unused Imports:** Run cleanup command or manually check for unused files.
